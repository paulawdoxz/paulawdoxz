# 👋 Hello! 

## 📖 Introduction

My name is Paula and I am a second-year Software Development student. I am a creative, trustworthy, and independent person who enjoys taking on challenges. I constantly try to learn new things and improve my skills.

As a second-year Software Development student, I am currently expanding my practical skills and preparing for future internship opportunities to gain real project experience.

In the future, I would like to specialize in databases, because I really enjoy working with PHP and SQL. I would also like to explore game development, and besides databases, I am not afraid to try new areas and specializations. I currently have a solid understanding of the basics and I am actively developing my practical experience by working on projects and exercises.
